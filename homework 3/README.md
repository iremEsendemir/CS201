## Homework 3: Biological Pathway Storage System

It is required to implement a system to store biological pathways in an organism using linked lists. Genes encode proteins, and multiple genes can encode subunits of a single protein. Proteins, working together, form biological pathways. The system will consist of pathways, proteins, and genes, each with unique IDs.

In this system, a linked list of pathways will be stored. For each pathway, a linked list of proteins participating in that pathway will be stored. For each protein, a linked list of genes encoding that protein will be stored.

There is a necessity to use <ins>sorted linked lists</ins> for storing pathways, proteins, and genes.
