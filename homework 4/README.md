## Homework 4: Building Navigation System

It is required to implement a system to help students navigate a complex university building to reach their TA's office. The building is represented as a grid of cubicles, where some cubicles are separated by walls. The goal is to find all paths from an origin cubicle to a target cubicle using a non-recursive depth-first search algorithm with a stack. Students can move horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally, and cannot pass through walls.

In this system, the building structure will be read from a file, stored as a graph, and functions will be implemented to display cubicles, adjacent cubicles, the building map, and find paths.

There is a necessity to use <ins>a non-recursive implementation with a stack</ins> for the depth-first search algorithm.
